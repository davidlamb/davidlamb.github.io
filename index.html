				<p>I am a postdoctoral research scholar at the Center for Urban Transportation Research, and Instructor with the College of Education at the University of South Florida. I am interested in Health and Medical Geography related topics, particularly disease diffusion. My dissertation research lies at the intersection of health, time geography and social media. Prior to pursuing my degree, I worked in the GIS related industry (public and private) for over 20 years. I began working with AutoCAD and then GIS after completing my B.A. in Geography. While working in the private industry I was employed by environmental consulting firms who consulted for mining corporations and water resources. I also worked as a GIS Research Associate at The Northern Institute in Darwin, Australia. There I assisted in research around the geography of gambling. My PhD training has included advanced quantitative training in regression analysis, generalized linear models, and multilevel models. As part of my teaching assistantship, I taught four semesters of Computer Cartography, and served as an assistant for Introduction to GIS and Research Methods (undergraduate).</p>
